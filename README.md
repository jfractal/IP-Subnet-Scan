# IP-Subnet-Scan

#Scripting Challenge Submission 2015

#ASSIGNED TASK:  Using Powershell, write a script or script cmdlet to collect the hostname 
#belonging to all available Windows 2012R2 servers within 192.168.1.0/25

    #    You are administrator and all remote access capabilities are wide open for your use
    #    All servers are running 2012R2.
    #    Do not use DNS to recover the hostnames
# Pay attention to minimizing the duration of the script's run time.
